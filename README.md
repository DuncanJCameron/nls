## Scottish 10 Index
An effort in Python data visualisation to compare the performance of major Scottish headquartered companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. It uses the yfinance, pandas, and matplotlib libraries to access, process and display data.
## Hollywood vs Bollywood
Adapted from a project for a university course in R, the notebook tests if Bollywood films are longer than Hollywood films. It processes JSON data and runs statistical tests.
## Sherlock Holmes
Once again using Python, we investigate how often Sherlock Holmes actually says "elementary", and then adapt our script for any text file. It uses file handling and string methods, and downloads text files from external sources.
